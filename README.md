# pandas-challenge

This project analyzes standardized test results for a city school district to aid in making decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

# Tools
* Python
* Pandas
* Numpy

# Findings
* From reviewing the data, higher budgets do not correlate with higher test scores. The top three schools with the highest overall budget (greater than 3.1M) had an overall passing grade at around ~54 percent. In contrast, some schools with lower budgets had overall average test scores in the 90's.
* Charter schools generally outperformed district schools in both math and reading.
* Large schools (between 2000 and 5000 students) generally had the lowest scores in both math and reading (overall passing scores in the 50s compared to the 80s and 90s for small and medium sized schools).
